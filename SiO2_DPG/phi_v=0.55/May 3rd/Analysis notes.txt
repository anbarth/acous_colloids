Phi=0.55

V difficult to analyse lower stress data, esp 0.1Pa
0.2Pa data: can't tell exactly where 5V application is. Chose a minima before the 10V application
0.4Pa data: can't tell where 5V is. 20V viscosity oddly high

2Pa data has non-monotonic change in dethickened viscosity with acoustic power
10Pa data looks like 8Pa and has lower viscosity at high V
